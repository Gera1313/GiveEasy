As a compassionate user, I want to easily browse and donate to fundraisers of my choice, so that I can support causes I care about and help them reach their fundraising goals.

```md
Given I am a visitor to the platform, when I navigate to the homepage, then I should see a list of active fundraisers, each showing a title, description, current total, and donation goal.

Given I am not logged in, when I try to create a new fundraiser or make a donation, then I should be prompted to log in or create an account.

Given I am a logged-in user, when I fill out the "Create Fundraiser" form with a title, description, goal amount, and optional image, then I should see my new fundraiser appear on the homepage.

Given I am viewing a specific fundraiser page, when I click the “Donate” button and enter an amount, then I should be directed to Stripe to complete the donation securely.

Given I am a logged-in user who has donated, when I complete my donation, then I should see my donation reflected in the fundraiser's total, and my donation history should appear in my profile.
